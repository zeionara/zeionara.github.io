# Gentoo

Gento installation instructions. However, this guide also covers setting up `Windows 11`, because I consider it useful to install this system before configuring `Gentoo` since it will be complicated to setup dual boot after you install `Linux`. Therefore, it is better to consider this option from the beginning rather than regret later, when you actually need it.
