Ok, let's get started. You decided to install Linux - how to do that? I strongly recommend to use `Gentoo`, which is one of really good linux distros which lets you to configure the system as you want. Besides, I strongly recommend you to aim for dual boot with `Windows`.

The perfect setup would be having [Windows Ghost Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/@GHOSTSPECTRE) on one SSD and [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) on the other. If you are going to follow this guide, the very first thing you would need to do is to install `Ghost Spectre`, because if you start from `Linux` and then try to install `Windows`, it will erase `Linux Bootloader` and you will need to restore it somehow. Here is an approximate set of instructions for you to prepare the installation medium and install `Windows`:

1. Create [ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) bootable USB following the instructions on the developer's website;
2. Download [Windows Ghost Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/@GHOSTSPECTRE) following links from the mentioned youtube channel, use [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract `.iso` from `.WPE64`, the password is something like `25h2`;
3. Download [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) from the official website (most likely you need `amd64`, `minimal installation CD`);
4. Copy obtained `.iso` images to the bootable USB;
5. Then reboot you PC, enter boot setup using `F2` or `Del` key depending on your firmware and configure bootable USB as the boot source, then reboot again and start installing Windows following the graphical installation tool, which should be quite easy (I recommend choosing `SUPERLITE` build);
6. Most likely, hardware drivers will be installed automatically on first boot, but in some cases, especially if you have newer hardware, you may need to install missing hardware drivers manually. For example, I had to manually find and install [Ethernet driver](https://drivers.softpedia.com/get/NETWORK-CARD/INTEL/ASUS-ROG-MAXIMUS-Z790-APEX-ENCORE-Intel-LAN-Driver-1-1-4-38-for-Windows-10-64-bit.shtml#download) for my motherboard;
7. Install [Firefox Browser](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/) (the `Ghost Spectre` Windows build does not have a default browser installed, so you would need to somehow download the browser to other device and pass the installation file to your new `Ghost Spectre` installation), [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/) and [VPN tool](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash/releases). If after installing [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) it crashes on startup, try to run it without `browser sandboxing`;
8. In settings, assign a unique name for your PC;
9. Install additonal languages (`Russian`, etc) using `Windows Control Panel`;
10. To complete the installation, run this `PowerShell` script, this will help you to enable personalization features, so to speak:

```sh
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
```

11. For disabling automatic updates press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press `Enter`. Scroll down to `Windows Update` service, right-click it, and select `Properties`. In the `Startup type` dropdown, select `Disabled`. Click `Stop` if the service is running, then `Apply` and `OK`.
